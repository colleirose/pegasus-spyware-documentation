# pegasus-spyware-documentation
Internal NSO Group documentation and technical notes for the Pegasus spyware. These were publicly produced as evidence in WhatsApp Inc. v. NSO Group Technologies Limited, 4:19-cv-07123, (N.D. Cal.) Many were originally placed under seal but unsealed later as the defendants had failed to show why the evidence should remain sealed.

A lot of documents in this case are duplicates, unhelpful, or lumped together. They will be organized as much as possible as I have the time.

Note that these documents ONLY concern what was relevant to proving the claims of an attack on the WhatsApp Android application. They don't cover other attack vectors, and they don't date past the time when WhatsApp was attacked. However, some statements in the documents do confirm that, *at the time of the WhatsApp attack*, NSO Group had not found or at least not looked for exploits in several other messaging applications. The documents also provide a significant amount of information on the UI and capabilities of Pegasus and how the company performs its research and development.

You can browse the case filings yourself at https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16395340/whatsapp-inc-v-nso-group-technologies-limited/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc (sorted descending because most of the interesting things were only unsealed recently).

<details><summary>Personal opinions on NSO's crimes (irrelevant to technical details)</summary>
NSO Group, despite forming a "business ethics committee", continues to be implicated in targeting journalists nearly every year. Just for some recent examples, see https://citizenlab.ca/2024/05/pegasus-russian-belarusian-speaking-opposition-media-europe/, https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2025/03/blasting-past-webp.html, https://securitylab.amnesty.org/latest/2025/03/journalists-targeted-with-pegasus-spyware/, etc. 

And we shall not forget that [they helped commit the premeditated murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/nso-spyware-used-to-target-family-of-jamal-khashoggi-leaked-data-shows-saudis-pegasus) and then defended their lawsuit by his grieving wife [on a technicality](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67506537/50/khashoggi-v-nso-group-technologies-limited/).

There has never been any real response to the overwhelming evidence that NSO Group is run by a group of people who want to profit and don't care whether people are murdered because of their actions. NSO Group doesn't care at all about fighting terrorism or serious crime, unless perhaps they believe that every human rights activist is a terrorist. It's obvious that NSO Group's idea of "ethical" isn't very high. And they [are doing everything they can to get back into the US market](https://www.wired.com/story/nso-group-the-vogel-group-lobbying-trump-administration/). 

I don't expect the lawsuit verdict to change anything about the spyware industry. Neither I, nor really anyone else, can do much to stop the actions of a government. But seeing how the media reporting on the filings in this case has been terrible and many people seem to be unaware that a lot of useful information is available in public record now, I ought to do what I can to spread news of it.

I hope that, some day, companies like NSO Group will go out of business, and the people who work for these businesses will finally face accountability.
